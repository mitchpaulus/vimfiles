This repository holds all the files for my vim setup.

On Windows, put this in $HOME/vimfiles/

On Unix, put this in ~/.vim/

I use Vundle to manage the plugins by other authors.

For my own plugins, I use the package feature of Vim 8. So need to
clone the four repositories
1. autocorrect.vim
1. latex-plus
1. vim-siemens-ppcl
1. vim-tex2text
to the directory `pack/mitchplugins/start/`

On Unix, you can run the shell script `plugininstall`. Need to create a
batch file for Windows.
